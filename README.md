<p>This repository holds the experiments and models as explored in the work, "Neural State-Space Modeling with
Latent Causal-Effect Disentanglement," for the MLMI 2022 Workshop. The work will be published in the upcoming conferece during September 18-22 and this repository is available early for visibility. We provide guidance on training the models, as well as supplementary experiments and visualizations.</p>
