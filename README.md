   [<a href='https://miccai2022.org/'>MICCAI</a>, <a href=''>Paper</a>]</h2>
<p>This repository holds the experiments and models as explored in the work, "Causal-effect modeling of system dynamics in the latent space: application to learning the Ventricular arrhythmia dynamics." We provide guidance on training the models, as well as supplementary experiments and visualizations.</p>
